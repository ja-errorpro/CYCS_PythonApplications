Actual Course Name :

  The Language Python (object-level view and meta-level view) and its applications

  什麼東西、什麼理念/哲學、什麼特色、如何記住、怎麼用(technology-integration vs. sophisticated programming)

On the design of a lang. (or the interface of a system) : "(要)怎麼做都可以！問題是「(該)怎麼做？」。"  

Q (Learning a lang.) : "一個人到底要知道多少才夠資格寫程式？"      # 低中高階層programmers的requirements

一個火星來的"scripting language"儼然已成為THE AI programming language of today - What this lang. is, why it has become so, and how to make the best use of the situation and the lang.

課程內容：

    哲學探討

    對於Python這個語言的探討(object-level view + meta-level view)

    基本上就是前兩項，若有閒暇、也會觸及以下兩項

      Comprehension and discussion of selected Python programs # probably only a few of it, due to time constraints

      Whenever possible, will also discuss about低中高階層programmers寫Python程式的風格要求

上課方式：

  "講學" + 於課堂中進行「點名Q/A」

  # 同學們在來上課之前應該要先看過當日進度！！！ 也必須要聽懂課堂上所提到與討論的「基本概念」！ (要打分數的！！！)
  # (最好也先run一下進度之中所show的程式碼！也不過就是copy、paste、ENTER而已，No big deal！) 
  # (用column-mode來delete出現於demo程式碼前的字元；選column時、Windows用NotePad++的Alt-click-Drag, Mac用atom的先click再Ctrl-shift-上或下箭頭)


  ＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊
  There are quite a few weeks with QUITE A LOT of class materials. If you don't prepare before you come to class, it will be VERY VERY DIFFICULT for you to comprehend what is said in class, not to mention answering questions regarding these class materials.
  ＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊


評分：  # 千萬別被上學期修過此門課的學長姐給誤導了！！！

  平時分數(問答與印象)   50%
  期中考               13%   # 上學期沒這個
  期末考               13%   # 上學期沒這個
  出席與possible作業    24%   # 上學期沒這個

  點名不到 扣出席1.5分(補到扣0.75) + Q/A評分 F 一次   # 上學期沒這要求

助教：陳續元 (csy8350163@gmail.com)

課程性質：

  不妨視為一門講學的課，但要打分數

  試著完整的了解Python這個語言；包括來龍去脈、種種細節、與該怎麼用
  # highly philosophical.

  My way. Not the 計概way.   # 「計概way」是當年為你訂做的啦！

  Also try to develop some in-depth feeling of the use of Python for programming (however, this will not be easy.)

課程期許 :

  希望這門“技術哲學課”能夠幫助「已經會寫Python程式的IT professionals」
                       把
                       the development/maintenance of「technology integration using Python」
                       掌控得更好

  重點： 已經會寫Python程式的IT professionals！！！

What this course is NOT :

  這不是門「教寫程式」的課！

  我們不「教」如何寫Python程式！！！

  你必須已經會寫程式！

  以做菜(番茄炒蛋)為例 ( 教「炒番茄炒蛋」 vs. 討論「番茄炒蛋」各種不同原料的特性與不同做法的優缺點，怎樣做"有可能"會比較好 + 來個新炒法如何 )

  我們在這門課(只是)討論Python這個語言的種種特色、
  以及Python程式(在不同的"軟體製作級別")"可能會比較好"的寫法。

  想學「Python程式設計」的人保證會對這門課大失所望！也完全不該來修！！！

Ideal learning situation : 

  It is desirable that you already took PL (Java OOP in the very least).

  # 有些(有關系統運作的)東西、就算你修過這兩門課也未見得會(真的真的)聽得懂，更何況是「如果這兩門課都沒修過那會怎樣？」。

講師介紹

1. First generation Macintosh programmer
2. Instructor of "Programming Language Principles" (PL) for 25 years
3. PM for the development/maintenance/use of CYCU-ICE's (past) CAL system
4. Old AI (but non-traditional)

  "Two weeks before the first day of classes, I decided to write my own book. My goals were:

   • Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50 pages.

   • Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize the jargon and define each term at first use.

   • Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difficult topics and split them into a series of small steps.

   • Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest.

   I needed a title, so on a whim I chose 「How to Think Like a Computer Scientist」."

6. Pascal, C (and C++), Java      # Pascal是Modula-3的前前身 (the 'Modula-3' on p. 2 of faq.pdf)

7. Linux as "the missing piece of the original, unspoken-of, C-intention"

8. The "Penn. State story"
   # No one knows everything! Everyone knows something! What are the things that you know？

---------------

# Since we are going to talk about Python both on the object-level and also on the meta-level ...

What does the term 'meta-level' mean？

  There is an object-level, and there is a meta-leval.

  On the object-level, things (objects) just work and work.

  On the meta-level, discussions are about what these objects are (who can participate) and what the rules they follow are or ought to be (and the advantages/disadvantages of such rules).

  On the meta-meta-level, discussions are about what 「the rules for analyzing the rules that are used on the object-level」 are or ought to be.

  Etc.

  最簡單的例子： 病人家屬  vs.  醫生與護士    ＃ 對悲慘至極狀況的道地同情心與同理心是非常耗心神的！ No one can afford it to do it EVERYDAY and ALL THE TIME！！！

  meta-level例一：

  在社會之中，人從事活動、也與人互動，在過程之中會有七情六慾與愛恨情仇。  // object-level

  社會學家研究人在社會之中的活動與互動(以及所謂的「人」又分哪些人)。     // meta-level之一
  心理學家研究人的七情六慾與愛恨情仇的來龍去脈。                      // meta-level之二

  方法論者研究『社會學家研究「社會之中人的活動與互動(與人有哪些人)」』應該要用什麼方法。 // meta-meta-level之一
  方法論者研究『心理學家研究「人的七情六慾與愛恨情仇的來龍去脈」』應該要用什麼方法。     // meta-meta-level之二

  「meta-方法論者」研究「方法論者在研究他們所研究的對象時應該要使用什麼方法」。          // meta-meta-meta-level

  Etc.

  meta-level例二：

  每個人(國民)都在思考要辦什麼活動或從事什麼活動以及這些活動有什麼內容。  // object-level

  法律學者思考國民活動所應遵守的規範以及國民與公民的資格等等(=法律)。    // meta-level

  憲法學者思考「法律」所應遵守的規範(=憲法)。                        // meta-meta-level

  思想家思考「憲法」所應遵守的規範(=超級法)                          // meta-meta-meta-level

  「超級法」是個無定義名詞(完全是靠宣揚與有效傳播與說服)；所以no more meta-level

So, what is our 「meta-level view of Python (and its applications)」 about in this course?

Mainly, we look at (and discuss about) Python from the perspective of language design :

A. What are the things that seem to be necessary ingredients of any "genuinely high-level" languages?
   ( genuinely high-level df= Anyone who wants to do programming can use this language to do it, often successfully )

B. Compare Python with languages we are familiar with (namely C/C++/Java) - the constructs and their underlying philosophy

C. We also introduce the new angles of perspectives that Python provides us with.

---------------

Python looks traditional (= somewhat similar to C/C++/Java) ; however, it is by no means traditional.

e.g.,

>>> [(x,y,z) for x in range(1,30) for y in range(x,30) for z in range(y,30) if x**2 + y**2 == z**2]    # basic math. concept of scientific domains.
[(3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (6, 8, 10), (7, 24, 25), (8, 15, 17), (9, 12, 15), (10, 24, 26), (12, 16, 20), (15, 20, 25), (20, 21, 29)]

>>> ( (x,y,z) for x in range(1,30) for y in range(x,30) for z in range(y,30) if x**2 + y**2 == z**2 )
<generator object <genexpr> at 0x7fc5702f1660>

>>> tuple( ( (x,y,z) for x in range(1,30) for y in range(x,30) for z in range(y,30) if x**2 + y**2 == z**2 ) )
((3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (6, 8, 10), (7, 24, 25), (8, 15, 17), (9, 12, 15), (10, 24, 26), (12, 16, 20), (15, 20, 25), (20, 21, 29))

>>> for (x,y,z) in tuple( ( (x,y,z) for x in range(1,30) for y in range(x,30) for z in range(y,30) if x**2 + y**2 == z**2 ) ) :
...   print( ' (', x, y, z, ')' )
...

# What are all these, exactly?

# Personally, I don't take "阿Python的運作就是這樣啊！" for an answer ... 

# However, if you are perfectly okay with this commonly seen "answer", then there does not seem to be any point for you to take this course.
# Because ＡＬＬ Ｉ ＤＯ in this course is ＪＵＳＴ trying to figure out what is going on here.

緣起(How this course comes about) : 

"Python不是應該要自己學嗎？ 為什麼要開這門課？" - A question from a very capable graduate (of CYCU-ICE)

(1) 三vs八的故事 ＋ It's another universe (of programming concepts) ＋ 三年出師？

(2)
    Python (available in 1991 ; feel in 2015 or 2017 ; explore in 2020) vs Java (available in 1996 ; feel in 2000 ; explore/use in 2004/2005 and since then) ;

    Python-intro. vs Python as a lang. from the perspective of language design

    Hopefully also from the perspective of running a software development/maintenance company

    How do we use Python effectively in writing sophisticated programs that integrate technology of diverse domains?

  Q : Why is Python “good for programming” ?

  Ans. : Basically, it is because it was written to be used by the designer himself(用Python替代Unix shell和C語言來進行Amoeba作業系統的系統管理) ; but also because it is “genuinely high level”. There are various reasons why Python is "genuinely high level." (We will explore this in more detail.)

  Q : Python was available in 1991 (Java was available around about 1996), why was Python not so received at the time when Java was so warmly received?

  Ans. : Interpreted lang. CPU time, memory cost, storage cost ; the situation has changed (quite dramatically in fact) to become in favor of Python, plus “high level” and a vast amount of “contributions” (mainly due to the high-level-ness of the language, but also due to the inherent usability of the language, the exact nature of which are yet to be explored in this course).

---------------

The very first lesson for you now (also the most important Python-core-concept ; it will be elaborated more and more until the end of this course) :

  The variable-value paradigm(流派) (a variable is a place-holder for a value) vs. the name-objects paradigm (the binding of a name is an object) 

  Every assignmentment statement is a (re-)declaration statement   # every assignment is a name-rebinding action, to be more precise





～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～ break ～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～





～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～

2. What makes Python a genuinely high-level language - an initial exposition

～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～

genuinely high-level df= Everyone who wants to write some kind of programs can really use this lang. to do it

-----------

The 縮排-hypothesis (by hsia) :

  「強迫縮排」is one of the necessary ingredients

  Because it forces the structure of a program to be visually clear to the programmer (which is important).

  # But how about the omission of ‘}’ or ‘end’ or ‘end if’ in Python？？？ // Something is over, but what is over? // Worse, you might not even know that it is over.

"Python hypothesis" (by hsia) : # actually, Python has several built-in hypotheses for this ; this is just one of it, albeit probably the most important one

  Interpreted language system (like shell) that is easy to use in writing code and running code (and immediately see the results)

  # interpreted = being able to try things out immediately (and see what comes out)

＃ How about using hsia's Our-C interpreter來驗證 the effectiveness of these two hypotheses?

-----------

“simple” algorithm  vs. sophisticated algorithm

maybe, just maybe, ...
simple (straightforward) = sequencing + if-else-if-else-if-else + loop with no nesting + classing + packaging

-----------

helpful feedback regarding syntax errors

-----------

easy-to-access and easy-to-understand documentation (perhaps with examples)

-----------

helpful examples (how about adding to it problems with graded levels of difficulties (just like CAL)？)

～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～

3. Python as a "programming-language like" shell-scripting language - back to the original ideal : Part I

～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～

  Python = 「理想C」的“現代實現版”   ＃「理想C」的現代版(C in 1991)的實現版(Python in 2010?)

The following seems to be the origin of Python :

"... shell scripts are best at moving around files and changing text data ...   # hsia : not exactly true (just witness 'make')

Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.

Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs — or as examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk."

- Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.4, Chapter One

"... We needed a better way to do system administration than by writing either C programs or Bourne shell scripts ..."

"... It occurred to me that a scripting language with a syntax like ABC but with access to the Amoeba system calls would fill the need."

- Python Frequently Asked Questions, Release 3.7.4, p. 2

# BTW, a Python program is not called a 'program' or 'code'; it is called a 'script' ...

-----------------------------------------

Introducing the notion of "king of kings" (actually, the concept has existed for a very long time ; it is just that hsia now gives it a name)

-----------------------------------------

A simple introduction of shell-scripting languages - using bash ("the opponent") as an example

-------

```sh
if date
then
  echo Hi
  echo $$
else
  echo Hello
fi
```

-------

```sh
if date ; date | cat
then
  echo Hi
  echo $$
else
  echo Hello
fi
```

-------

```sh
(( i = 1 ))          # 也可以是： i=1
while (( i < 5 ))	   # 也可以是： (( $i < 5 ))
do
  (( i = i + 1 ))    # 也可以是： i=$(( $i + 1 ))
  echo ${i}Hello
done
```

-------

# Syntax

# Below, ';' can be replaced by ENTER (newline) ; However, ';;' cannot be replaced by ENTER

for name [ [ in [ word ... ] ] ; ] do list ; done

for (( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 )) ; do list ; done   # no '$' needed in the three expressions

select name [ in word ] ; do list ; done

if list; then list; [ elif list; then list; ] ... [ else list; ] fi

while list-1; do list-2; done

until list-1; do list-2; done

case word in [ [(] pattern [ | pattern ] ... ) list ;; ] ... esac

-------

The idea of "king of kings" ...

How shell-scripts are used in general ...  # just witness 'make' ( even though the content of a make-file is not really a shell script )

-----------------------------------------

How Python programs (Python scripts) may be used as (shell) scripts ...

一、
```sh
> chmod u+x PythonScript
> ./PythonScript
...
> cp PythonScript ~/bin/PythonCmd
> PythonCmd   # assuming that $PATH contains '/home/myUserID/bin'
```
... 

二、

(a) 
```sh
> ./argParseProg03Out | ./argParseProg03In
```
# or, if these two are already made to be Linux commands ...

```sh
> argParseProg03Out | argParseProg03In      # the so-called "list piping" in this class
```

(b) 

```sh
> ./argParseProg03Out -of Result357.py && ./argParseProg03In -if Result357.py    # '-of' and '-if' are options for the scripts
```

# or, if the two are already made Linux commands ... 

```sh
> argParseProg03Out -of Result357.py && argParseProg03In -if Result357.p
```

-----------------------------------------

Python environment as a shell environment？ (ideas exist ; tools are there ; but maybe still not mature enough)

```sh
> ls ~/bin  # just to show that we have StartUpScript.py under the bin of our home directory
```
... StartUpScript.py ...

```sh
> python3.9 -i ~/bin/StartUpScript.py   # go into an interative session ; 基本上應等於 >> from StartUpScript import * <<，但'from import'會受到sys.path內容的束縛

```

Python 3.9.13 (main, Aug 25 2022, 18:29:29)
[Clang 12.0.0 ] on darwin

--- StartUpScript.py loaded ---    註：這幾行註解是由 StartUpScript.py 所print (they are not printed by python3.9)

```sh
>>> pprint( sys.path )

```

# To use a coding scheme other than UTF-8, put, e.g., '# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-' on this line, where 'cp1252' (Windows-1252) must be a valid codecs supported by Python.

```py
import os
import subprocess
import sys
from pprint import pprint  

## Since we now have B(), L() should not be needed.
## One "drawback" with L() is that it runs 'cmd' in the background,
## causing '>>>' to be displayed before the output of 'cmd' is displayed,
## making it look like the user is not prompted after the output of 'cmd' appears.

# def L( cmd ) :
#   subprocess.Popen( cmd, shell=True, executable='/bin/bash' )

# 'S' means 'sh' (the shell that is used to run the 'cmd'

def S( cmd ) :
  os.system( cmd )

# 'B' means 'bash' ;
#
# Remember to always use >>' ... '<< to specify a bash-command (i.e., use single-quotes for specifying the cmd-string).
# In specifying the command itself (i.e., the >>...<< of >>'...'<<), use >>"<< as much as possible.
# e.g.,
# B( 'LANG=zh_TW.UTF-8 ; var123="The dollar expression \$(( 3 + 5 )) will give us $((3+5)), while \`date\` will give us `date`" ; echo $var123 ' )
#
# If the use of >>'<< is absolutely necessary for specifying the bash-command to execute, see if >>\'<< will work.
# However, there is no guarantee (that >>\'<< will work).
#
# Of course, we can also run >>B( './BashTestScript.sh' )<< to simplify typing.
# But to try to prevent from potential hacking, the file permission bits of this shell script (e.g., BashTestScript.sh)
# should be such that the 'setuid' and 'setgid' bits are both set (i.e., do >>chmod 7755 BashTestScript.sh<< in advance)

def B( cmd ) :
  os.system( "bash -c '" + cmd + "'" )

# # Better not print below if we are to perform something like list piping, so as not to distort the output
# print('\nPython %s on %s' % (sys.version, sys.platform))
# print( "\n--- StartUpScript.py loaded ---\n" )
```
